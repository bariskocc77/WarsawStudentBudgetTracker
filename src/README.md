# 🇵🇱 Warsaw Student Budget Tracker

> A simple, efficient, and console-based expense tracking application designed for international students in Poland.

## 📖 Overview
Managing finances as a student can be tricky, especially with currency differences. This project creates a **persistent expense tracking system** that allows users to record daily expenses in **PLN (Polish Złoty)**. It uses local file storage to ensure data is never lost.

## 🚀 Features
- **Add Expenses:** Record details including description, amount (PLN), and category.
- **Persistent Storage:** All data is automatically saved to a local CSV file (`expenses.csv`).
- **Data Persistence:** Expenses are reloaded automatically when the application restarts.
- **Locale Handling:** Automatically handles dot (`.`) vs comma (`,`) decimal separators for international compatibility.
- **English Interface:** Fully internationalized code and UI.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java 17+
- **Concepts:** OOP (Object Oriented Programming), File I/O, Exception Handling, Collections (ArrayList).
- **Architecture:** Modular design with Manager/Model separation.
